		<h2 id="week1">Week 1</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Worked with the team to assign different tasks
			<li>Learned how to use Git and HTML
			<li>Created an initial flow diagram for CAN system
			<li>Thought about using dedicated CAN cards for NODES instead of multiple AXEMAN boards
			<li>Recorded Meeting minutes
		</ul>
		<h2 id="week2">Week 2</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Reworked the system flow diagram
			<li>Team discussed the methods of talking to the elevator
			<li>Started to test communication between different nodes (HCS12) and PCAN
		</ul>
		<h2 id="week3">Week 3</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Completed About page for Project, will continue to update through out the project
			<li>Finalized the flow diagram
			<li>Planned the push button and LEDs flow into the CAN system 
		</ul>
		<h2 id="week4">Week 4</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Monday: Started to gather parts to create push button/leds circuit for AXMAN
			<li>Monday: Fired up the first LED with the push button
			<li>Tuesday: Finalized register initialization to turn on all LEDs and enabling all buttons for ElevatorNode. <i><a href="harewaredesign.html" target="_blank">link</a></i>
			<li>Wednesday: Implimented logic with the ElevatorNode, such that door does not open when not on a floor
			<li>Thursday: Integrated with rest of the TX/RX CAN code.
			<li>Thursday: Set up LEDs for floor level indication, robust for later intgration
			<li>Thursday: Created Floor Nodes for rest of the group to assist continue integration
			<li>Friday-Sunday: Time off
		</ul>
		<h2 id="week5">Week 5</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Monday: Writing documentation, assisting with last minute integration
			<li>Tuesday-Thursday: Studying for Math mid-term
			<li>Friday: Imported local html to Github for online access. This included running though the software assignment for assisting in uploading to GitHub

		<h2 id="week6">Week 6</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Monday (5 P.M): Team meeting of work expectation for this week. 
			<li>Monday (5:30 P.M): Included brainstorming duties. (Data base RX/TX, GUI, PCAN driver install, Statemachine designing) 
			<li>Tuesday (10 A.M): Divided tasks. Akem on GUI, Arish on Database
			<li>Tuesday (10:15 A.M): Divided tasks. Shiv on PCAN driver install on Linux and design of State-machine and documentation
			<li>Tuesday (10:30 A.M): Divided tasks. MLD on PCAN driver install on Windows and state-machine implimentation
			<li>Wednsday (5:00 P.M): Started to design the initial state machine sudo code.
			<li>Friday(4PM-7PM): Cleaning up floor node codes with MLD. Initially the floor nodes would send multiple messages into the can when requesting floor. Now they only request once per button press.
			<li>Saturday(10AM): Got the elevator node buttons working with moving the actual elevator with MLD
			<li>Saturday(12PM): New state-machine design with contribution of MLD and AKEM. Follow this <i><a href="./Images/designstate.JPG" target="_blank">link</a></i>.
		</ul>
		<h2 id="week7">Week 7</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Monday(12PM): Started to impliment the state machine in actual code by setting flags for each button press.
			<li>Tuesday: Absent
			<li>Wednsday(5PM): Distributed work with the group. I talked to MLD for splitting our tasks or finishing the State Machine and PCAN
			<li>Thursday(8PM): Gathered information on how to complete driver install on Linux machine for PCAN
			<li>Friday(12PM): Finishing the Software Assignment for the group
			<li>Sunday(3PM): Driver install issue for the PCAN with the linux machine, error in installing via sudo apt-get
		</ul>
		<h2 id="week8">Week 8</h2>
